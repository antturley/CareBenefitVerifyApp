## Setup and Deployment Guide

This guide walks you from environment setup to deploying and customizing the Care Benefit Verification App in a scratch org.

Challenges I Faced
Working on this project was exciting, but it came with some tricky parts. Here are a few of the biggest challenges I ran into along the way:

Hard-to-Find Help When I tried to set up Care Benefit Verification, there wasnâ€™t much clear help or instructions online. The official Salesforce setup didnâ€™t even explain how to make the parts work together. I had to guess, test, and keep fixing things until I found the right way to make it work. It took a lot of time and patience.

Setting Up the Package Namespace Making the 2nd-generation package (2GP) itself was easy. But adding a namespace took extra work. I learned that I couldnâ€™t do everything in just one Salesforce org. I needed two different Developer Edition orgsâ€”and one of them couldnâ€™t even be a Dev Hub. That part was pretty confusing until I figured it out.

Learning Something Totally New I had never worked with Health Cloudâ€™s benefit verification tools before. So I spent a lot of time reading, researching, and testing things to understand how it all fit together. Even though it was tough at times, I really enjoyed learning and building something new from scratch.

Assumptions & Early Decisions
At the start of this project, I made a few assumptions that shaped my first approach:

Queueable Approach for External Requests I assumed I could build a Queueable Apex class to send benefit verification requests in bulk. This wouldâ€™ve made retry logic easier and allowed me to batch multiple CareBenefitVerifyRequest__c (CBVR) records in a single outbound call.

Trigger-Based Population I originally thought I could simply fire a trigger on CBVR records and let users populate them manually via a custom button or Lightning Web Component (LWC).

How My Approach Evolved
After reading the Health Cloud documentation more closely, I realized the native Benefit Verification component automatically creates CBVR and CoverageBenefit records. That meant:

My trigger-based approach needed to shift.

I had to write logic that responded to these records after they were created, not before.

I transitioned to using object-level triggers for CareBenefitVerifyRequest__c and CoverageBenefit__c instead of relying on custom flows.

Quick Decision: Custom Task vs. Case
Looking back, I realize that I could have used Salesforce Cases to track benefit verification tasks. That wouldâ€™ve saved time and aligned better with Salesforceâ€™s built-in automation. But with time running short, I created a custom object (CareBenefitVerificationTask__c) to track the work instead along with a few other HealthCloud Native Objects.

---

### External Credential Configuration

25. **Create External Credential**
   - Authentication Protocol: Custom
   - Add Principal: Username + Password

---

### ðŸ›  Development Highlights

- Custom Apex classes:  
  `healthcloudext.BenefitsVerificationRequest`, `CareBenefitVerifyHandler`, etc.

- Custom objects include:
  - `CareBenefitVerifyRequest`
  - Verification Task Object (`CareBenefitVerificationTask__c`)
  
- Custom layouts, record types, and permission sets

- Programmatic metadata fetch:
  ```bash
  sf project retrieve start --metadata "<type>:<name>" --target-org HealthCloudDev
  ```

- Queue-based task routing (queue must be created manually post-deploy)

### External Request Payload Format
The integration with the benefits verification service sends a structured JSON request with the following nested format:

```json
{
  "patient": {
    "firstName": "Jane",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "dateOfBirth": "1985-03-12",
    "gender": "F"
  },
  "insurance": {
    "insuranceProviderName": "Anthem Blue Cross",
    "policyNumber": "POL123456789",
    "groupNumber": "GRP987654",
    "subscriberId": "SUB0001234"
  },
  "provider": {
    "npi": 1234567890,
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Smith"
  },
  "service": {
    "serviceType": "30",
    "serviceDate": "2024-06-01",
    "diagnosisCode": "R51",
    "procedureCode": "99385"
  }
}
```

> This payload is generated from the BenefitVerificationRequest class and transmitted via the configured ExternalCredential. Adjust the structure as needed if your remote service expects alternative naming conventions or field mappings.

**Benefits Verification Request Model**
When Salesforce Health Cloud sends a request to an external benefits verification service, it uses the Benefits Verification Request model. This request is typically triggered by the Verify Benefits button in the UI or programmatically through Apex.

Required Fields
```memberAccountId```: ID of the patientâ€™s Account record

```memberPlanId```: ID of the Member Plan record

```providerNpi```: National Provider Identifier

```encounterDate```: Date of service

```serviceTypeCodes```: Array of service type codes (e.g., "30" for General Medical)

Sample JSON Request
```json
{
  "memberAccountId": "0018b00002ABC123",
  "memberPlanId": "a0H8b00000XYZ789",
  "providerNpi": "1234567890",
  "providerOrganizationName": "Sunrise Medical Group",
  "providerType": "PrimaryCare",
  "encounterDate": "2024-07-01",
  "serviceTypeCodes": ["30", "98"]
}
```

> This payload is sent from the Benefit Verification Component to the class defined in your Care Benefit Verification Settings.

**Benefits Verification Response Model**
After a successful call to the external benefits verification service, Salesforce Health Cloud receives a structured response that maps to the CareBenefitVerifyRequest__c and CoverageBenefit__c records.

Key Response Fields
```careBenefitVerifyRequestId```: ID of the original verification request

```coverageBenefitId```: ID of the created CoverageBenefit__c record

```isSuccess```: Boolean flag indicating if the verification succeeded

```code```: Status or error code returned by the external service

```message```: Human-readable message from the service

Sample JSON Response
```json
{
  "careBenefitVerifyRequestId": "a0B8b00000ABC123",
  "coverageBenefitId": "a0C8b00000XYZ789",
  "isSuccess": true,
  "code": "200",
  "message": "Verification completed successfully"
}
```

> This response is processed by Salesforce's Benefit Verification Component to update the verification request record and create or update related coverage benefit records. If isSuccess is false, the message and code fields help identify the issue.

## Project Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to download the Salesforce DX project from GitHub, authorize your org, and deploy metadata using the Salesforce CLI. This process ensures a smooth and reproducible setup experience across development environments.

Step 1: Clone the GitHub Repo
First, open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
cd <your-repo-name>
```
> Replace <your-username> and <your-repo-name> with your GitHub account name and the project repo name.

Step 2: Authorize Your Salesforce Org
Use the Salesforce CLI to log in to the org where you want to deploy the metadata:

```bash
sf org login web --alias MyTargetOrg
This opens a browser window for you to authenticate.
```

After logging in, the alias MyTargetOrg can be used in all future commands.

Step 3: Set Default Org (Optional but helpful)
If you want to make this your default org for the project:

```bash
sf config set target-org MyTargetOrg
```

Step 4: Deploy the Project Metadata
From your project root directory, deploy all source files:

```bash
sf project deploy start --target-org MyTargetOrg
```

You can also preview the changes first with:

```bash
sf project deploy preview --target-org MyTargetOrg
```

Step 5: Verify Deployment
You can now open the org and verify everything deployed correctly:

```bash
sf org open --target-org MyTargetOrg
```

Navigate to App Launcher and check for custom objects, Lightning components, or other deployed metadata.

### Notes

- CoverageBenefit record is created via Apex, no need to create it manually
- Ensure all required fields are visible and marked on the layouts
- The MemberPlan object was extended with provider info for proper routing
- Queues and task routing logic are included in `CareBenefitVerifyReqTriggerHandler`

Navigate to App Launcher and check for custom objects, Lightning components, or other deployed metadata.
